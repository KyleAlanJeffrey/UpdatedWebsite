Hi I'm Kyle!
I recieved my degree in robotics where I did a Senior Thesis on simulating Milipede movements with cheap leg actuators.
I've done web development this last five years as a hobbyist where I've made multiple web apps.
The last two years I've worked across two different divisions at Google Robotics and Google X, solving general problems with python written robot applications
