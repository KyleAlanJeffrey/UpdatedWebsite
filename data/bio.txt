Hi I'm Kyle!
I recieved my degree in robotics where I did a Senior Thesis on simulating Milipede movements with cheap leg actuators.
I've done web development this last five years as a hobbyist where I've made multiple web apps.
Prior to my current position I worked across two different divisions at Google Robotics and Google X, solving general problems with python written robot applications
My previous boss gave a ted talk on one of our projects (See Music Mode in Work Projects)
The last year and a half, I've been at Stout Industrial helping Farmers with autonomous weeders powered by AI vision.
